# Food Delivery Time Prediction

This project aims to predict the approximate delivery time for food orders based on several key factors such as driver age, driver rating, and the total distance between the restaurant and the customer. By analyzing these inputs, the model provides an estimated time that can help both customers and delivery services optimize their experience.

## Project Overview

In today’s fast-paced environment, predicting accurate delivery times can significantly enhance customer satisfaction and operational efficiency. This project applies machine learning to predict the delivery time based on the following features:
- **Driver Age**: Age of the delivery driver.
- **Driver Rating**: The rating of the driver, based on previous deliveries.
- **Total Distance**: The total distance from the restaurant to the customer’s location (in kilometers or miles).

## Features

- **Data Preprocessing**: The dataset is cleaned and preprocessed, dealing with missing values, outliers, and encoding categorical features.
- **Modeling**: Various machine learning models, such as Linear Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forests, were tested to predict the delivery time.
- **Evaluation**: Model performance is evaluated using metrics such as MAE (Mean Absolute Error), RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error), and R-squared.

## Tools & Technologies Used

- Python
- Scikit-learn
- Pandas & NumPy
- Matplotlib & Seaborn (for data visualization)
- Jupyter Notebook

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
   https://github.com/Adithya-Siddam/Delivery-Time-Prediction.git
    ```
2. Install the required libraries:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

To use the model for predicting food delivery time:
1. Run the notebook and input the driver age, driver rating, and total distance.
2. The model will output the estimated delivery time.

## Results

The model was trained and tested on a sample dataset, achieving a reasonable prediction accuracy. Further improvement can be achieved by fine-tuning the hyperparameters and exploring additional features like traffic conditions, weather, etc.

## Future Work

- Integrating additional factors such as weather conditions, traffic patterns, and time of day to improve accuracy.
- Deploying the model using Flask or a similar framework for real-time predictions.
